My updated code for the tutorial.  Download and unpack the archived website to follow the lessons in your browser.

For most of the examples there are two different updates to the code.

1. The minimum needed for modern Windows systems.
2. Using modern WinAPI features.

Enjoy!

### Notes
The first two examples have additional code samples using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).  To show the differences between writing code using the C-based Desktop WinAPI and the C++-based MFC framework.

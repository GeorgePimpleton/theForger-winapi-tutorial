### Notes
There are two separate directories for the sources because of how Visual Studio creates resource script files (.rc and resource.h).  There's a lot of excessive text used for the visual resource editor in the VS IDE.  Text that can be stripped out.  The trimmed down resource files can still be opened for visual inspection in the IDE.

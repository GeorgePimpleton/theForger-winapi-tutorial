### 07_ctl_one

One aspect of this example source that bugs me is the text message at the bottom of the dialog which shows the number of added items is only updated when the user selects a single line of text in the edit box and not when the users tells the app to add a number of strings.  I've modified the source to update the number on an Add.  See "07_ctl_one a.c" for the change.

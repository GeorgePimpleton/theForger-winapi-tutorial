### The initial test application created with MFC
I wondered if a simple app that displays just a message box was possible using MFC.  Well, it is.  test_MFC.cpp shows how.

This example shows that MFC is not as feature rich as the Windows Desktop WinAPI in some aspects, Message boxes, for example.  Being unable to specify a window title is not good.

The rest of the code examples (except for the next one) will NOT be redone using MFC.  Doing it yourself would be a learning experience after learning C++ and the WinAPI.

### The test application created with MFC
I wondered what a simple app that displays a message box was possible using MFC.  Well, it is.  test_MFC.cpp shows how.

This example shows that MFC is not as feature rich as the Windows Desktop WinAPI in some aspects.

The rest of the code examples will not be redone using MFC.  Doing it yourself would be a learning experience.

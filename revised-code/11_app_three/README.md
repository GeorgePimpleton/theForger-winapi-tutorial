### 11_app_three
Text files in Windows can be a tricky thing, I know of no reasonable way to make a generic app that can agnostically edit windows and load/save text as ANSI or Unicode.  You have to specify using the ANSI or Unicode versions of the Desktop WinAPI functions.  For this reason there is no "minimal" rewrite version of this particular app, only the "modern" rewrite.

The Common Controls to the rescue!   Using them instead of the older controls works!

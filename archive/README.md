An archive of [theForger's Win32 API Programming Tutorial](http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/) site in zip format.  For reference purposes as comparison with my updated code, as well as a backup in case one day the site "goes dark."

~~As of 15 December 2025 it looks like theForger's tutorial has indeed gone dark, "Server Not Found."~~

A temporary internet glitch, the tutorial is back,  but still shows what might happen in the future.

### Notes
I archived the site using WinHTTrack. https://www.httrack.com/
